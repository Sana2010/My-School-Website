            <p id="defenition">Reading helps to expand the mind and give us more ideas. Reading has been proven to keep our minds young, healthy and sharp. Everything you read fills your head with new bits of information, and you never know when it might come in handy. The more knowledge you have, the better-equipped you are to tackle any challenge you’ll ever face. The more you read, the more words you gain exposure to, and they’ll inevitably make their way into your everyday vocabulary. In addition to the relaxation that accompanies reading a good book, it’s possible that the subject you read about can bring about immense inner peace and tranquility.</p>

            <p id="defenition">Since most arts and crafts activities consist of moving fingers and hands, they help in developing fine motor skills. Simple actions like holding a paintbrush and coloring with pencils help strengthen muscles and improve their control. Arts and crafts activities can enhance the children's dexterity and agility. When creating an arts and crafts project, children are able to develop their fine motor skills. Art also allows for your child to expand their essential vocabulary. They'll learn the names of different shapes, colors, and materials without it seeming like a chore or a memorization exercise.</p>

                <p id="explanation">School assembly clarifies school activities and programmes and focuses on co-curricular life. It strengthens work of the school. School assembly should be conducted with complete and active participation of students. Morning assembly should be well-planned. School assemblies provide the opportunity for kids to develop their confidence by speaking up and sharing their ideas. There will always be kids who already have the confidence to speak in front of large groups, but a good assembly leader will make sure everyone has a chance to get involved. School's morning assembly is the best platform to encourage the students who have achieved something in academics or extra-curricular activities. When the achievers are awarded in front of everyone, they feel encouraged. This encouragement gives them the enthusiasm to achieve more.</p>

        <p id="FounderInformation">BY NOW THE MOTHER OF TWO SONS AND INCREASINGLY DISILLUSIONED WITH THE ANGLICISATION OF WHAT WAS PERCEIVED TO BE QUALITY EDUCATION, WHEN SHE HAD TO FIND A GOOD SCHOOL FOR HER YOUNGER SON TO GO TO, SHE DECIDED THAT THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE SYSTEM WAS HER OWN WAY - SO SHE STARTED A SCHOOL - A DREAM, A CAUSE AND A GOAL WHICH SHE SPENT THE REST OF HER LIFE REALISING. THE PADMA SESHADRI BALA BHAVAN BEGAN AS A TWO-ROOM AFFAIR "UPSTAIRS" WITH THIRTEEN CHILDREN ( AND THAT INCLUDED HER OWN SON). THE THEN MAYOR OF CHENNAI, TARA CHERIAN, INAUGURATED WHAT WAS TO BE SMALL A BEGINNING OF A BIG IDEA. THE SCHOOL NOW BECAME AN ALL-CONSUMING PASSION AND HENCE SHE TOOK A B.ED FROM THE MYSORE UNIVERSITY (SHE BECAME A GOLD MEDALLIST - AT THE AGE OF FORTY FIVE) AND FOLLOWED IT WITH A M.ED. AND A MASTERS IN HISTORY FROM THE MADRAS UNIVERSITY. NOW HER INSTINCTS HAD THE BACKING OF FORMAL DEGREES.

            NOT SATISFIED WITH A FORMAL DEGREE, MRS. YGP VISITED THE USA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WITH SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES TO ENHANCE HER POTENTIAL AS AN EDUCATIONAL PLANNER TO BENEFIT THE PSBB GROUP OF SCHOOLS. ON HER RETURN SHE BROUGHT ABOUT A METAMORPHOSIS IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION, BY IMPLEMENTING UNIQUE AND NOVEL TEACHING METHODS IN HER SCHOOLS. WHAT STANDS OUT TO HER CREDIT IS THE WAY IN WHICH SHE INDIANISED THE WESTERN THOUGHT. IT IS THIS IDEA WHICH MADE HER INTRODUCE AUTHORS CHAIR, TRANSCEDENTAL MEDITATION, YOGA , VEDAS, INDIAN DANCE AND MUSIC AS PART OF THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM, THEREBY MAKING EVERY STUDENT OF PSBB A HOLISTIC PERSONALITY.</p>

While there a lot of talking on happy classrooms, the school sets an example for how happy classrooms are, buzzing with relentless energy, enthusiasm, and making it a happening place.

Apart from holistic learning, all round development, as a parent, I am proud to say that children have learnt beyond the textbook and balanced, engaged and comprehensive curriculum has prepared my child to face the challenges in world with open arms. It has also fostered in him tremendous respect for the environment, the elderly and the less privileged in the society. My Pranams to everyone in the PSBBM family. They are definitely Millennials, but with a difference.</p>

        <p id="comment">As a parent of a student studying at The PSBB Millennium School, Coimbatore, and also as a person who has been invited for several occasions to the school, I truly believe that this school teaches every student to be passionate about learning and to be a life-long learner. It encourages the children to passionately pursue their interests, while also providing them the holistic knowledge necessary for today’s world. Academic excellence apt for a global environment combined with a firm grounding in Indian values is what makes PSBB Millennium unique.</p>

        <p id="comment">In this challenging times the teachers are giving online support for my ward. The classes are helpful and supportive for my daughter. The children are engaged throughout the week. Regular attendance is taken by the teachers and a small instruction to the parents for being vigilant while they take up the online tests shows the support and help rendered by the school and teachers. Hope everything should end peacefully so that the children can take up their board exam with confidence.</p>

        <p id="comment"> I am impressed by the Value Education classes taught in our school. My grandson has truly got benefitted. This year his value education classes covered Mahabharata and every single class was a learning experience for him. He was always excited to attend the classes and carried home interesting incidents about the Epic. And he began reading the epic. He can flawlessly narrate the entire story mentioning each and every character. My sincere appreciation to all the teachers who instil values in young minds.</p>
